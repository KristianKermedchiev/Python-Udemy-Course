# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.
#
# Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.
#
# Line 8 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. For this to work, you must enter all the names as names followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name
#
# Example Input
# Angela, Ben, Jenny, Michael, Chloe
# Note: notice that there is a space between the comma and the next name.
#
# Example Output
# Michael is going to buy the meal today!
import random

# Import the random module here

# Split string method
names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma. ")
names = names_string.split(", ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇

random_person = random.randint(0, len(names) - 1)
person = names[random_person]
print(f'{person} is going to buy the meal today!')
